# Project Description

## Overview
This project is a web application built using the Vue framework, aimed at providing a seamless user experience. It has been packaged using NPM tools to simplify the deployment process. By following a few simple steps, users can launch the demo and explore the application's features.

## Features
- **Vue Framework:** The project leverages the Vue framework, a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue's component-based architecture enables modularity and reusability, making it easier to develop and maintain the application.

- **NPM Packaging:** The project has been packaged using NPM (Node Package Manager) tools, streamlining the deployment process. With NPM, all the required dependencies are managed efficiently, ensuring the application runs smoothly across different environments.

- **Easy Demo Launch:** To launch the demo, users only need to start the `nginx.exe` server. Nginx is a popular open-source web server that provides a robust and high-performance platform for hosting web applications. Starting the server will make the application accessible via a web browser, allowing users to interact with its functionalities effortlessly.
